# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04

      # You can use PyPy versions in python-version.
      # For example, pypy2 and pypy3
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.7]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
